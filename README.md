# Personal Portfolio

## Inspiration
As a software engineer, it's as important to know how to _present_ your products as it is to actually build them. With this in mind, I wanted to make an interface through which people could view my information, projects, and personality, while learning how to use state-of-the-art web development tools at the same time.

## Architecture
I built this portfolio using React with TypeScript, implemented some server-side optimization features with Next.js, and deployed it using Vercel. React made it easy for me to reuse a bunch of my visual components and manage the state of some animated planets. Next.js implements lazy image loading automatically, which speeds up my site a bit. That service also makes deploying my site with Vercel much easier.
